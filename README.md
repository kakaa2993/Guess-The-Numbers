## About The Project:
It's a simple web application that allows the user to create his top 10 movies at all times, and he can constantly update his list and keep track of which movies to recommend to people.

- <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5</a> for the UI.  
- <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> for the Database.  
- <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> for the Backend.  
- <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja2</a> for the Templating.


## Run the website:
Regular web servers can't run Python applications, so a special server type was used(Web Server Gateway Interface 'WSGI') to run Python applications.
The most popular: <a href="http://www.gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a> ( run on Linux only!!!)


**To run the website:**
